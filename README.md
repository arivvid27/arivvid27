### The Weekend me :
I love to play Rocket League and Destiny 2 : Beyond Light in the weekends on my Xbox. my gamertag is 'Apollo11548"

### The Curious me? :
When im curious, I sometimes take apart old devices and play with electronics. Most of the time, I just google stuff up.

### The Bored me :
I usually just read a book.

### The Furious me:
# *I DONT HAVE A SINGLE BIT OF INSPIRATION OF WHAT I CAN CODE!!!!*

### The Ending me:
So, yeah. thats pretty much me.
